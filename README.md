# Query Recognition in Incremental Search

The Query Recognition in Incremental Search (**QRIS**) is a passive attack system that leverages the size and timing information of incremental search packets to infer the user's query.

QRIS exploits the information leakage contributed by four factors at different data layers:
1. Exact data sizes exposed by TLS ciphers.
2. Static compression lengths of HTTP/2 headers.
3. Accurate keystroke timings exposed by AJAX models.
4. Chinese query details revealed by Pinyin IME.
	
QRIS consists of three stages applied in a pipeline architecture:
1. **State correlation** aims to relate keystroke packets emitted by the incremental search website to specific DFA states.
2. **Ambiguity reduction** utilizes query size distinguishability to reduce the scale of the query set.
3. **Query inference** leverages user's typing rhythm to infer queries from the filtered query set.

Currently support English and Chinese queries. Supported websites include Google, Tmall, Facebook, Baidu, Yahoo, Wikipedia, Csdn, Twitch, Bing.

By default, the [AOL search dataset](https://jeffhuang.com/search_query_logs.html) is used as English query set, and the [THU Open Chinese Lexicon](http://thuocl.thunlp.org/) (THUOCL) is used as Chinese query set. The default keystroke timing model is trained on the [136M keystroke dataset](https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/136Mkeystrokes/).


## Installation

1. Use pip with Python 3.x to install the QRIS package:

```
> pip install https://github.com/incremental-search/qris/archive/main.zip
```

2. (Optional) Download the preloaded metadata for the AOL and THUOCL query sets. Unzip it into the QRIS python installation directory.

## Usage

The QRIS python package provides a command `qris` to infer the entered search query from a `pcap` file that contains network traffic of incremental search.

Use the command `qris` to get the help message:

```
usage: qris [-h] [--website NAME] [--chinese] [--queryset PATH]
            [--bigrams PATH] [--trident] [--topk K] [--verbose]
            pcap

Query Recognition in Incremental Search

positional arguments:
  pcap             filename of the pcap.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --website NAME   name of the website. If not specified, try to identify.
  --chinese        Chinese query entered using Pinyin IME.
  --queryset PATH  filename of the query set (csv format).
  --bigrams PATH   filename of the bigram timing model (csv format).
  --trident        broswer engine is Trident, including broswer IE and old
                   version of Edge.
  --topk K         list the top K inferred queries.
  --verbose        show inference details.
```

Use the following command to run QRIS with default optional arguments:

```
> qris [xx].pcap
```
